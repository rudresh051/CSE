# What is an Operating System?
* A program that acts as an intermediary between a user  
of a computer and the computer hardware
* Operating system goals:
    * Execute user programs and make solving user problems
    easier
        * e.g. Mouse Clicks through GUI
        * Basic operation are there but way has changed
    * Make the computer system convenient to use
        * e.g. Pen drive attaching display device
    * Use the computer hardware in an efficient manner
        * Resource Management
        * Resource should be available 
        * e.g. Printer job explanation

# Computer System Structure
* Computer system can be divided into four components:
    * Hardware — provides basic computing resources
        * CPU, memory, I/o devices
    * Operating system
        * Controls and coordinates use of hardware among various applications and users
    * Application programs — define the ways in which the system resources are used to solve the computing problems of the users
        * Word processors, compilers, web browsers, database systems, video games
    * Users
        * People, machines, other computers

# What Operating Systems Do
* The operating system controls the hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for the various users.
* We can also view a computer system as consisting of hardware, software,
and data.
* The operating system provides the means for proper use of these resources in the operation of the computer system.
* An operating system is similar to a government. Like a government, it
performs no useful function by itself. It simply provides an environment
within which other programs can do useful work.
* To understand more fully the operating system's role, we need to explore operating systems from two viewpoints:
    * The user
    * The system.
