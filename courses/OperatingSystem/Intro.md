# What is an Operating System?
* A program that acts as an intermediary between a user  
of a computer and the computer hardware
* Operating system goals:
    * Execute user programs and make solving user problems
    easier
        * e.g. Mouse Clicks through GUI
        * Basic operation are there but way has changed
    * Make the computer system convenient to use
        * e.g. Pen drive attaching display device
    * Use the computer hardware in an efficient manner
        * Resource Management
        * Resource should be available 
        * e.g. Printer job explanation

# Computer System Structure
* Computer system can be divided into four components:
    * Hardware — provides basic computing resources
        * CPU, memory, I/o devices
    * Operating system
        * Controls and coordinates use of hardware among various applications and users
    * Application programs — define the ways in which the system resources are used to solve the computing problems of the users
        * Word processors, compilers, web browsers, database systems, video games
    * Users
        * People, machines, other computers
