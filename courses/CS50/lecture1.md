base-2
computers use 0 and 1
Transistors or hardware - On or Off

Binary digit 

* Representing things

base-10 system or decimal system
e.g. 123 => 100 + 20 + 3

* Byte - 8 bits
e.g. 11111111 = 255

or 2^8-1 = 255

* Representaing a letter
e.g. A => Assigned a number => underneath the hood it's storing a pattern of 0's and 1's that represents the number 65

01000001

ASCII

* Emoji - It is technically just characters

Unicode - It is a superset of ASCII
It use 16 bit character, 24 bit character and 32 bit character

2^32

We represent things a little more compactly.
